## Easily collect and process taxonomic and inventory data through a unified search system.

TaxonHub was born from the need of scientists to collect, process and analyze large amounts of data in a simple way. Such data is distributed in different sites, each with its own methodology and search filters, and in different storage formats. Besides, the manual collection and processing are more susceptible to human errors.

To achieve this, TaxonHub was developed, with the goal of unifying the data and performing comparisons of source, identifying errors. It has a module for taxonomic data collection and processing, and a module for inventory data collection and processing.

It was used NodeJs for the construction of the server, this being applied using architecture SOLID, the framework ReactJS for the implementation of the client and Chakra UI as a library of style for front-end.

### Operation

1. The server, through scrapping verifies the version of the database of World of flora.
2. If outdated, downloads the file and inserts it into the database.
3. The client attaches and sends a CSV file containing the binomial names of the species.
4. The server receives the CSV file and searches for the species in the database, validating the taxonomy or searching for inventories in both databases.
5. The server crosses the bases and creates a CSV file for download of the user, identified by UUID (generated by the client).
6. After generating the CSV file, it is returned to the client the link relative to the download of the file.
